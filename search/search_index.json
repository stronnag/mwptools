For most users these will be automatically provided by a build-essentials type of package transparently to the user. Prior to late May 2021, the build system used a convoluted Makefile . For Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu, WSL etc.) there is a simple \"one stop\" installation script , as well as a x86_64 \"Release\" .deb archive. For Arch Linux, you can install using the AUR package mwptools-git Rationale # In its early days, make was a suitable build tool. As mwptools has gained in features and functionality, this has become un-maintainable. The migration to meson and ninja solves this problem and allows the project structure to be rationalised. Usage # Migration # Please ensure your extant mwptools instance does not have untracked files: git clean -fd -fx git pull First time # Set up the meson build system from the top level: meson build --buildtype=release --strip [--prefix $HOME/.local`] For a user / non-system install, set --prefix $HOME/.local This will install the binaries in $HOME/.local/bin , which should be added to $PATH as required. For a Linux system wide install, set --prefix /usr For FreeBSD (*BSD), for a system-wide install, don't set --prefix as the default ( /usr/local ) is suitable Unless you need a multi-user setup, a local install is preferable, as you don't need sudo to install, and you'll not risk messing up build permissions. If you're using a really old OS (e.g. Debian 10), you may also need export XDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/share:$HOME/.local/share for a local install. Easy first-time install on Debian and Ubuntu # Download the first time build script Make it executable chmod +x deb-install.sh Run it ./deb-install.sh -y Note that the script may ask for a password to install system packages The resulting executables are in ~/.local/bin . Ensure this exists on $PATH If you get messages like Removing /home/$USER/.config/mwp/.layout.xml 0 and Failed to save layout, remains in /tmp/.mwp.xxxxxx.xml you also need export XDG_DATA_DIRS=$XDG_DATA_DIRS:$HOME/.local/share . This is rare and should not occur on supported platforms . Build and update # cd build # for a local install (and cygwin) ninja install # for system install ninja && sudo ninja install Accessing the serial port # The user needs to have read / write permissions on the serial port in order to communicate with a flight controller.

Consider migrating to a local install Help!!!! # You've installed a new version but you still get the old one! # If you used the deb-install.sh script, then it installed everything into $HOME/.local/bin (and other folders under ~/.local ). This is nice because: mwp does not pollute the system directories; you don't need sudo to install it. Linux (like most other OS) has the concept of a PATH , a list of places where it looks for executable files). You can see this from a terminal: ## a colon separated list echo $PATH So check that $HOME/.local/bin is on $PATH ; preferably near the front. If it is, then the problem may be that the older mwp also exists elsewhere on the PATH, and the system will not re-evaluate the possible chain of locations if it previously found the file it wants. So, maybe you have an old install. You didn't remove it (alas); so the system thinks that mwp is /usr/bin/mwp ; in fact it's now $HOME/.local/bin/mwp If $HOME/.local/bin is on the PATH before /usr/bin , the you have two choices: # reset the path search hash -r # mwp, where art thou? Hopefully now is ~/.local/bin which mwp # From **this terminal** executing mwp will run the location reported by `which mwp` or Log out, log in. The PATH will be re-evaluated. If $HOME/.local/bin is not on PATH. then it needs to be added to a login file ( .profile , .bashrc , .bash_profile etc.). Modern distros do this for you, however if you've updated an older install you may have to add it yourself. # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists if [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\" fi # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists if [ -d \"$HOME/.local/bin\" ] ; then PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\" fi If an older (perhaps Makefile generated) mwp exists; then you should remove all evidence of an earlier system install. find /usr -iname \\*mwp\\* review the list and as root, delete the old files.

As a result, the pilot has to be ensure by some other means that the mission will clear any raised elevations on the mission path. For INAV 3.0, missions may be either relative to home or absolute (above a datum, see below ). mwp includes a mwp-plot-elevations tool that performs mission and terrain analysis. Prior to 2021-05-03, this was provided by a ruby script in mwptools/samples ; since 2021-05-03 there is a Go program (in mwptools/mwp-plot-elevations ) which is an enhanced version, and supports INAV 3.0 absolute altitude missions. If you're running an older version of mwp , or you haven't installed the Go compiler, you can use the older, less functional ruby version, but the Go version is recommended as: It supports INAV 3.0 absolute altitude waypoints It can update LAND waypoints to offset the difference between the home ground elevation and the LAND WP ground elevation. It's much faster Its usage is compatible with the deprecated ruby version. Bug fixes and improvements Both the ruby application and the Go application are platform independent and can be used without mwp for mission terrain analysis. Obsolescence Note Prior to 2021-05, the ruby version was installed as mwp-plot-elevations.rb ; now it's installed as plain mwp-plot-elevations in order that the superior Go version is a drop in replacement. mwp-plot-elevations can rewrite the mission file with new elevations to provide a specified ground clearance. Video Tutorial & UI integration # From of 2018-12-06, mwp-plot-elevations is integrated into the mwp application. There is a video tutorial . Obsolescence Note The video uses the older ruby application, but that doesn't really affect basic functionality. Sample output # Given the mission shown below: and knowing that the land rises to the north and west, we can check that we do indeed have adequate clearance with the planned route and elevations: # for decimal '.' locales $ mwp-plot-elevations -- home 50.9104826,-1.5350745 --plotfile profile.svg west_field.mission # for decimal ',' locales $ mwp-plot-elevations --home \"50,9104826 -1,5350745\" --plotfile profile.svg west_field.mission where: west_field.mission is the MW-XML mission file (via mwp , INAV configurator, [ezgui, mission planner for INAV] or impload ) the --home lat,lon option defines the home position (which may also be set by the environment variable MWP_HOME ), the command line having preference. Note that for modern mwp generated mission files, this information is provided in the mission file. The graphical output is profile.svg , via the --plotfile option. The result from this command is an SVG file, which can be displayed with common image tools ( eog , ImageMagick display et al). It can also be converted to a raster image using e.g. rsvg-convert ); a sample is shown below: The red line represents the planned mission altitudes (which are defined relative to the estimated home location), and the green area represents the terrain. As we can see, we clear the hill (and other terrain), but cannot guarantee that we have LOS to lowest point of the mission, or that we're clear of the trees. We can also specify a \"clearance\" option, in the image below this was set to 16m. Where the blue line is above the red line, one should review that the mission elevations are adequate. Creating a new mission file # It is also possible (see command line options below) to write out a new mission that takes into account the clearance ( margin parameter). If we then plot this new mission file, we can see that we are at least margin (in this example 16m) distance clear of the terrain. Note that the original mission elevations are still taken into account. We can also ignore these, so we end up the absolute clearance distance above the terrain. $ mwp-plot-elevations nm_west_field.mission --output /tmp/p1.mission --no-mission-alts Dependencies # The mwp-plot-elevations has NO dependency on mwp or Linux / FreeBSD, it can just as easily be run on MacOS or MS Windows. It does however has some dependencies: Go version # Go compiler (1.13 or later) Ruby version # ruby (2.0 or later) ruby 'gems' (libraries) nokogiri gnuplot gnuplot is easily provided (by your distro or from a binary download), and the nokogiri dependency is also easily satisfied by either the distro or Ruby's gem command: $ apt install ruby-nokogiri ### or ### > gem install nokogiri ## mwp Windows / Cygwin $ cyg-apt install ruby-nokogiri Using the package manager is recommended for non-proprietary operating systems. On all operating systems, the terrain graph is also plotted interactively, regardless of whether the -p (save SVG plot) option has been specified. The following shows the UI on Windows (it's pretty much the same on other OS). Caveats # 3rd party terrain data is not guaranteed, either as to its absolute accuracy, nor to its coverage. Terrain data does not take into account other obstacles (trees, buildings, power lines etc). The tool does not faithfully model the vehicle motion. As multi-rotor and fixed-wing have different climb behaviours, this would be quite complex. RTH altitude has to specified if you wish to model it, and assumes 'AT LEAST' behaviour. Datum # Digital elevation services can use the WGS84 Ellipsoid or \"sea level\"; survey maps typically use AMSL (Above Mean Sea Level); GPS can report either or both of WGS Ellipsoid and above MSL (mean sea level). The \"sea level\" used by Bing Elevations is computed from a magnetic anomaly / gravity database and may not be the same as the AMSL \"sea level\" used by the survey. Caveat User . mwp currently uses Bing \"Sea level\" to obtain elevations. The user should apply a suitable margin. INAV firmware uses the GPS' AMSL value, so INAV and mwp are consistent on this. The INAV configurator uses Bing's Ellipsoid values (by default, it can be changed). Due to the granularity of the AMSL grid used by GPS and the gravity based Bing Sea Level, there may be a significant difference between ASML, \"sea level\", WGS84 Ellipsoid and Survey heights, for example, for a test point of 54.149461 -4.669315 (summit of South Barrule, Isle of Man): Google Earth : 470m Ordnance Survey (OS) Map (official survey): 483m Bing Ellipsoid (Configurator): 526m Bing \"Sea Level\" (mwp): 470m So who's right? # Many years ago, I took a GPS up South Barrule. It reads 485m, this pretty much agrees with the OS (Survey) height (AMSL). So the real issue is with the DEM available online (either Bing or Google). The 'sea-level\" height DEM reports for this location is c. 13m below Ordnance Survey AMSL value whilst the WGS84 ellipsoid value is 43m above the OS AMSL value.

Configuration File # As well as specifying options such as home location, clearance margin and RTH altitude on the command line (or as an environment variable), some or all of these options may be set in a configuration file. mwp-plot-elevations looks for options in one of the following (in order) ./.elev-plot.rc (i.e. current directory), $HOME/.config/mwp/elev-plot , and $HOME/.elev-plot.rc . The configuration file is a simple text file containing key=value pairs. Blank lines and lines beginning with # are ignored; the following example illustrates the recognised keys. Note that $HOME/.config/mwp/elev-plot is the preferred location, as this is also used by mwp to populate its graphical dialogue to launch the analysis tool. # settings for mwp-plot-elevations margin = 16 home = 50.910476,-1.535038 # for ',' locales # home = 50,910476 -1,535038 rth-alt=25 # 'sanity' is the home -> WP1 distance check; default if not set here is 100m sanity = 200 Usage Examples # # Interactive plot, using the above configuration file: $ mwp-plot-elevations nm_west_field.mission # Interactive plot. save SVG file $ mwp-plot-elevations --plotfile /tmp/mission.svg nm_west_field.mission # Interactive plot. save SVG file, rewrite mission file $ mwp-plot-elevations --plotfile /tmp/mission.svg --output new_west_field.mission nm_west_field.mission # Interactive plot. save SVG file, rewrite mission file, override clearance margin (20m) $ mwp-plot-elevationsb --plotfile /tmp/mission.svg --outout new_west_field.mission --margin 20 nm_west_field.mission # Interactive plot. save SVG file, rewrite mission file, # override clearance margin (20m), reduce RTH altitude (22m) $ mwp-plot-elevations --plotfile /tmp/mission.svg --output new_west_field.mission --margin 20 --rth-alt 22 nm_west_field.mission Another contrived example ... create a mission in Google Earth (tied to ground), save as KMZ, convert to MWXML mission file with impload (0 altitude). Use mwp-plot-elevations.rb to calculate a safe mission. KMZ planned in Google Earth # Conversion tools # # convert the saved KMZ file to a MWXML mission file $ impload convert /tmp/IOM.kmz /tmp/perwick.mission # Verify the elevations and clearance with plot-elevations.rb $ mwp-plot-elevations.rb -h 54.068826,-4.735472 -m 40 /tmp/perwick.mission Looks OK (well, apart from the flying through the hill, due to impload's default altitude of 20m). If we specify that a new mission file be generated ( --output ), the updated mission is also plotted, and we can see that this clears the hill. mwp-plot-elevations --home 54.068826,-4.735472 --margin 40 --output /tmp/perwick-ok.mission /tmp/perwick.mission It's not yet perfect, we could be more aggressive in reaching just the clearance altitude, but we clear the hill!. Climb and Dive Angle Report # Mission used for climb /dive example As of 2021-06, it's also possible to get climb and dive angles for the calculated mission. Before I added the WP12 => WP7 jump in the mission shown below, it was almost OK; below the desired clearance in a couple of places and just failing to clear the hill at WP15. After adding the JUMP, it hits the terrain pretty conclusively between WP12 and WP7. The modified mission is interesting, as it has to adjust the WPs within the JUMP for the worst case (so the WP7, the second pass is definitive). The final result: We also get a climb / dive report, currently to STDOUT and $TMP/mwpmission-angles.txt (tab separated for easy analysis). $ mwp-plot-elevations --margin 25 -no-mission-alts --output /tmp/n.mission \\ --home 54.125205,-4.730322 -rth-alt 40 mwp/missions/IoM/barrule-jump.mission HOME - WP1 21.3\u00b0 (climb) WP1 - WP2 -13.9\u00b0 (dive) WP2 - WP3 16.2\u00b0 (climb) WP3 - WP4 -8.1\u00b0 (dive) WP4 - WP5 11.4\u00b0 (climb) WP5 - WP6 4.9\u00b0 (climb) WP6 - WP7 -6.6\u00b0 (dive) WP7 - WP8 -8.9\u00b0 (dive) WP8 - WP9 1.3\u00b0 (climb) WP9 - WP10 7.0\u00b0 (climb) WP10 - WP11 4.4\u00b0 (climb) WP11 - WP12 -11.9\u00b0 (dive) WP12 - WP7 0.3\u00b0 (climb) WP7 - WP8 -8.9\u00b0 (dive) WP8 - WP9 1.3\u00b0 (climb) WP9 - WP10 7.0\u00b0 (climb) WP10 - WP11 4.4\u00b0 (climb) WP11 - WP12 -11.9\u00b0 (dive) WP12 - WP14 2.5\u00b0 (climb) WP14 - WP15 -5.2\u00b0 (dive) WP15 - RTH -3.6\u00b0 (dive) If you run mwp-plot-elevations via mwp , the information is presented in a separate window. mwp can also highlight any legs that exceed user-defined (not 0) climb and dive angle limits.

If you always fly in a flat area, or always arm at the same point, this wasn't really an issue; you could always use mwp's terrain analysis to check that you'd clear any obstructions. However, if you armed some (vertical) distance from the arming point assumed when the plan was created, the absolute, (AMSL) elevation of the WP would differ by the ground difference between the assumed arming point at planning time and the actual arming point at take off. In the worst case (arming at an 'zero' absolute elevation well below the 'assumed at planning time' location), this could result in automated flight into terrain, which is generally undesirable. Absolute mission altitudes addresses this issue, as the AMSL elevation of the WP is fixed and does not depend on arming location. Land WP ground elevation setting # A similar issue existed prior to INAV 3.0 for the LAND WP; the initial implementation assumed that the LAND WP site ground elevation was at approximately the same ground elevation as the arming location. INAV computes landing behaviour based on relative altitude from home; if the actual LAND site was lower than home, then the descent would be slow; if it was higher, then slowdown might not occur and there would be a hard landing (for MR). For FW the final approach and motor-off would be sub-optimal. The required land elevation uses the P2 WP parameter, in metres. If LAND is a relative altitude WP, then this is the altitude difference between the assumed home and the LAND location. If LAND is an absolute altitude WP, then this is the absolute (AMSL) altitude of the LAND location. mwp support for 3.0 features # mwp supports the new feature in the Mission Editor and Terrain Analysis. Mission Editor # The mission editor gains two new context message options: Convert Altitudes (selection, inet) Update LAND offset (selected, inet) The text in parentheses indicating that a selection of point and an internet ( inet ) connection is potentially needed.

Internet connectivity is needed for automatic LAND elevation adjustment, as mwp needs to known the LAND site ground elevation. However, the values can all the edited manually if necessary: In the image below: The R/A column indicates the altitude mode ( R elative to home, A bsolute). \"Convert Altitudes ...\" is enabled, because geospatial WPs are selected. \"Update LAND offset ...\" is not enabled; it requires a single LAND WP to be selected. When \"Convert Altitudes ...\" is invoked, the user is presented with the following: The user can select to convert the selected WPs to either Relative or Absolute. Only geospatial WPs are converted, and if the WP is already of the selected mode, it will be ignored. The user can select the reference home altitude by: Entering a manual value, does not require an internet connection. Dragging the brown \"home\" icon to the required position Using the position of the 1st geographic WP, which does not have to be in the conversion selection. If \"Apply\" is clicked, the conversion proceeds, downloading elevation data from the internet as required. Cancel closes the dialogue and clears the selection from the Mission Editor. When \"Update LAND offset ...\" is invoked, the user is presented with a similar dialogue, without the Altitude Mode selection, as that's implicit from the selected waypoint. In the image below, WP14 has been moved down the valley: When this is applied, the WP14 value (parameter 2, \"Elv\" in the cell headers), should decrease, which it does, from 183m to 175m (AMSL).

The one usage is when inav-radar is active; if the GCS icon is enabled (either by manual location or driven by gpsd ), then rather than being a passive 'GCS' node, mwp will masquerade as an 'INAV' node and advertise the GCS (icon) location to other nodes. This implies that you have sufficient LoRa slots to support this node usage.","title":"GCS Location Icon"},{"location":"inav-4.0-multi-missions/","text":"INAV 4.0 Multi-Mission Support # Overview # In INAV 4.0, the FC supports \"multi-missions\", that is allowing the user to upload and store multiple missions.

When a row is selected, the column headers will change to indicate the data fields appropriate to the point type (in particular the \u201cparameters\u201d P1,P2,P3 whose interpretation is dependent on the point type. Position. The position of a way point may be changed by dragging the way point icon on the map or editing in the list. Order. The order of way points may be changed by either: Using the \u201cMove Up\u201d and \u201cMove Down\u201d entries from the mission pop-up menu; or Dragging the list item to the desired position. In order to drag, the entry must be 'grabbed' on the ID column. In that screen-shot (below), way point 7 is being dropped between way points 3 and 4. At the end of the drop, the list and markers on the map will be re-ordered. Type. The way point type may be selected from a drop down menu embedded in the \"Type\" column of the list: Once the type has been changed, default parameters for that way point type or action will be set. The type may also be set by a right mouse button click on the map symbol. Altitude. New points are created with the default altitude (from the \"Preferences\"). Some basic validation is performed Parameters P1, P2 and P3. The parameters P1,P2 and P3 are integer values that have a meaning specific to the way-point type or action. For example, for action type of JUMP, P1 is the point to which to jump, and P2 is the number of repeats. This usage is documented in the INAV wiki . Delete. The delete action will delete the selected (highlighted) way point(s). If no way point is selected, this option has no affect. Add Shape # If a SET POI point is added to the mission, (there may also be other extant way-points), this option will display a dialogue to enter the number of points in a shape, the radial distance (from the SET POI to each point), an offset angle and the direction of rotation. i.e this defines a polygon around the POI. The offset is relative to North. If you wanted the lines to be horizontal / vertical, specify an offset of 45\u00b0 for a square. Shape points are appended to any extant mission points, and the shape tool may be invoked multiple times, for example to create 'concentric' circles. The SET_POI point may be deleted, unless you really want SET_POI functionality. Location Updates # Bulk location updates may be applied to selected waypoints. If an item if left black (or 0), then no adjustment is applied to that axis. Offsets are in metres, regardless of the user's preference distance unit.

The user can override these by creating an eponymous file in the user configuration directory, ~/.config/mwp/pixmaps/ . Such user configurations are never over-written on upgrade. For example, to replace a mwp specific icon; i.e. replace the GCS Location icon ( $prefix/share/mwp/pixmaps/gcs.svg ) with a user defined file ~/.config/mwp/pixmaps/gcs.svg . While the file name must be consistent, the format does not have to be; the replacement could be be a PNG, rather than SVG; we're not MSDOS and file \"extensions\" are an advisory illusion. Example # e.g. replace the inav-radar icon. mkdir -p ~/config/mwp/pixmaps # copy the preview image cp ~/.local/share/mwp/pixmaps/preview.png ~/config/mwp/pixmaps/ # (optionally) resize it to 32x32 pixels mogrify -resize 80% ~/config/mwp/pixmaps/preview.png # and rename it, mwp doesn't care about the 'extension', this is not MSDOS:) mv ~/config/mwp/pixmaps/preview.png ~/config/mwp/pixmaps/inav-radar.svg # and verify ... perfect file ~/.config/mwp/pixmaps/inav-radar.svg /home/jrh/.config/mwp/pixmaps/inav-radar.svg: PNG image data, 32 x 32, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced Note also that the resize step is no longer required, as mwp scales the icon according to the misc-icon-size setting.

Full size aircraft reported by the MAVLink 'Traffic Report' message. An example is the uAvionix PingRX , a compact device that receives ADS-B location data from full sized aircraft and publishes the locations as MAVLink. For a ground based installation, this device has around a 40Km detection radius. MAVLink ICD . Full size aircraft reported using the SBS-1 Basestation streaming TCP protocol .

Proximity alerts (visual and audible) for manned (ADS-B / SBS-1) aircraft, based on planned or actual home location. mwp Configuration # mwp can receive the 'radar' data over one or two connections, either or both may be active, and mwp can receive and display 'own vehicle' telemetry (MSP, LTM or Smartpost), 'INAV-radar' and 'MAVlink Traffic' data simultaneously. Radar data may be received over: The main serial port device (see caveat for INAV-radar) or device(s) defined by the radar-device CLI or configuration parameter (MAVLink Traffic, INAV-radar) The radar-device option is defined by the standard mwp naming scheme: A serial device node, with optional baud rate, e.g.: /dev/ttyACM0 , /dev/ttyUSB4@567600 , /dev/rfcomm3 Serial defaults to 115200 baud, but may be set in the device name (@baudrate) A Bluetooth address (for BT bridges) 00:0B:0D:87:13:A2 A UDP address, e.g. for simulation, recording replays or serial multiplexer (INAV, mavlink). udp://:30001 local UDP listener. A SBS-1 source, defined by a special URI: sbs://[[host][:port]] Host and port are optional, defaulting to localhost and 30003 . So the minimal \"URI\" is sbs:// .

It is not managed via the serial Connect button. Using the main serial port # The main serial port may be used for MavLink Traffic without any further configuration. For INAV-radar, to use the main MSP port for INAV-radar (vice using --radar-device ), it is still necessary to add a command option to mwp ; it needs to told to relax the default inbound MSP direction check. This is enabled as mwp --relaxed-msp which should be 'mainly harmless' for normal operations. It's entirely acceptable to put this in ~/config/mwp/cmdopts to make it the default, as the protocol check dilution is slight.

Completed Note that in every case, the FC device node is auto-detected. Note also that the download speed is approximately 5 times greater than one would expect from the nominal baud rate (115200 ~= 10800 bytes/sec). flash_dump.rb # flash_dump.rb is another tool for downloading blackbox logs from on-board flash. Whereas flashgo uses MSP, flash_dump.rb uses CLI commands and is thus rather more fragile and requires that the FC firmware is compiled with #define USE_FLASH_TOOLS ( which is not the default ). It allows the temporary use of higher baud rates on USB (e.g. 921600). If it fails, you may have to reset the baud rate via the CLI, if the configurator is unable to connect > 115200 baud. $ flash_dump.rb --help flash_dump.rb [options] file Download bb from flash -s, --serial-device=DEV -e, --erase -E, --erase-only -o, --output=FILE -b, --baud=RATE -B, --super-baud=RATE -?, --help Show this message Unlike flashdl which auto-detects serial ports, flash_dump.rb tries /dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyACM0 , or the device given with -d . The \"super baud\" rate must be specified to use a faster rate than the FC default: $ flash_dump.rb -B 921600 /dev/ttyUSB0 Changing baud rate to 921600 Found \"serial 0 1 115200 38400 115200 115200\" setting serial 0 1 921600 38400 115200 115200 Reopened at 921600 Size = 1638400 read 1638400 / 1638400 100% 0s Got 1638400 bytes in 18.8s 87268.8 b/s Exiting After the download has completed, the serial port is reset to the previously configured baud rate (typically 115200). Note the very high speed of the download, 87268 bytes /sec; this is almost 9 times faster than the standard baud (and 9x the speed of using the configurator with a USB board). Should the download fail and the board serial speed is not reset automatically, it will be necessary to manually reset UART1, possibly using cliterm . So, had the above failed, it could be rescued by pasting in the \"Found\" line above: $ cliterm -b 921600 open /dev/ttyUSB0 Entering CLI Mode, type 'exit' to return, or 'help' # serial 0 1 115200 38400 115200 115200 # save Saving Rebooting cliterm # cliterm is a simple terminal program for interacting with the INAV CLI. Unlike alternative tools ( picocom , minicom etc.), it will auto-detect the FC serial device, uses 115200 as the baud rate and, by default, automatically enters the CLI. In INAV 5.0 and later, it will set cli_delay in case you've compiled the firmware with GCC 11. $ cliterm --help Usage: cliterm [OPTION?] - cli tool Help Options: -h, --help Show help options Application Options: -b, --baud=115200 baud rate -d, --device device -n, --noinit=false noinit -m, --msc=false msc mode -g, --gpspass=false gpspassthrough -p, --gpspass=false gpspassthrough -f, --file file --eolmode=[cr,lf,crlf,crcrlf] eol mode With -g , -p , the FC is put into GPS passthrouigh mode, in order to use tools like ublox-cli or u-center (sic). -m , --msc causes the FC to reboot in MSC (USB Mass Storage) mode. The options -n (don't enter CLI automatically) and -m may be useful when accessing other devices (for example a 3DR radio, HC-12 radio or ESP8266) in command mode. cliterm understands Ctrl-D as \"quit CLI without saving\". You should quit cliterm with Ctrl-C, having first exited the CLI in the FC ( save , exit , Ctrl-D). Or after save , exit , cliterm will exit when the FC is rebooted, by seeing the tear-down of the USB device node.","title":"mwp miscellaneous tools"},{"location":"mwp-miscellaneous-tools/#mwp-miscellaneous-tools","text":"","title":"mwp miscellaneous tools"},{"location":"mwp-miscellaneous-tools/#overview","text":"The mwp suite contains numerous simple command line tools developed since 2015 in order to aid development of INAV, development of mwp and diagnosing numerous (often 3rd party) problems, more so in the early days.

FreeBSD Strictly, mwp requires gstreamer1.0-plugins-gtk which should be included in gstreamer1.0-plugins-good ; on FreeBSD it is necessary to install gstreamer1-plugins-gtk explicitly. Live stream mode (GCS) # There is now a Video Stream option under the view menu. Selecting this option opens the source selection dialogue. Camera devices offering a \"video4linux\" interface (i.e most webcams) will be auto-detected. There is also the option to enter a URI, which could be a http / https , rtsp or other standard streaming protocol, or even a file. The selected source will then play in a separate window. This window will remain above the mwp application and can be resized, minimised and moved. In stream mode, there are minimal video controls; a play/pause button and volume control. Note the volume is that of the video, the overall volume is controlled by the system volume control. Blackbox replay mode (BBL replay) # The Blackbox log replay chooser also offers a video replay option. Here the user can select a media file and start options, i.e. whether and when to start the video replay with respect to the start of the BB log replay. In order for mwp to start the replay, the Start check-button must be selected. If it is: The user can enter an optional time (minutes : seconds) that defines when the video starts relative to the start of the BB log: No time is entered, or the time is 0:00 : The video starts at the start of the BBL replay. The time is positive (e.g. 2:34.5 (two minutes, 34.5 seconds), as the example: Here the video would start when BB log starts, at an offset 2:34.5 into the video (i.e. the pilot started FPV recording 2m 34.5s before arming the aircraft). If the time is negative (including \"-0\" minutes), then the start of the video is delayed by that amount; so -0:57 would delay the start of the video by 57 seconds relative to the start of BB log replay. Pausing the replay will pause the video, and vice-versa. When playing a file (vice a stream), the player gains a progress bar (which can be used to position the stream and \"beginning\" and \"end\" buttons.
