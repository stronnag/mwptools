# BulletGCSS Telemetry

## mwp requirements

{{ mwp }} works with the web-based Ground Control Station [BulletGCSS](https://bulletgcss.fpvsampa.com/) MQTT protocol, tested with both a `fl2mqtt` simulation and a recorded live session.

The MQTT component is build if either `paho-mqtt` or `mosquitto` libraries are detected; `paho-mtqq` is preferred.

    ## Arch ##
    yay -S paho-mqtt-c-git  ## or you favourite AUR helper
    # or #
    sudo pacman -S mosquitto

    ## Debian and derivatives ##
    ### Debian testing / Ubuntu 20.10 + for paho ###
    sudo apt install libpaho-mqtt-dev
    # or #
    sudo apt install libmosquitto-dev

    ## Fedora ##
    dnf install paho-c-devel
    # or #
    dnf install mosquitto-devel

    ## FreeBSD ##
    ## paho-mqtt
    # Clone github repo and build from source. Configure with cmake -DPAHO_WITH_SSL=true ..
    git clone https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c.git
    cd paho.mqtt.c
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DPAHO_WITH_SSL=true ..
    make && sudo make install

    # or #
    sudo pkg install mosquitto

If you have both `paho-mqtt` and `mosquitto` installed, then `paho-mqtt` is preferred.

## Usage

Once {{ mwp }} is built with a MQTT library, you can use an MQTT URL as a device name, for example for the demo that runs every other hour (00:00, 02:00 .. 22:00) UTC on `broker.emqx.io` with topic `org/mwptools/mqtt/otxplayer`, the mqtt URI for mwp would be:

    mqtt://broker.emqx.io/org/mwptools/mqtt/otxplayer

Or in general:

    mqtt://[user[:pass]@]broker[:port]/topic[?cafile=file]

Note:

* port is the mqtt port (typically and by default 1883), not the websocket port.
* if you want to use TLS, then the port will be different, often 8883, and you might need to provide the broker's CA file.
* As {{ mwp }} uses a pseudo-URL for the broker,topic etc, the topic should comply with rules for a URL rather than the more relaxed MQTT topic specification. This is a feature.

The scheme part (`mqtt://`) in the example is interpreted as:

* `ws://` - Websocket (vice TCP socket), ensure the websocket port is also specified, requires 'paho-mqtt' as the provider.
* `wss://` - Encrypted websocket, ensure the TLS websocket port is also specified. TLS validation is performed using the operating system. Not supported by `mosquitto`; requires `paho-mqtt` 1.39 or later.
* `mqtts://`,`ssl://` - Secure (TLS) TCP connection. Ensure the TLS port is specified. TLS validation is performed using the operating system, unless `cafile` is provided.
* `mqtt://` - TCP connection. If `?cafile=file` is specified, then that is used for TLS validation (and the TLS port should be specified).

MQTT looks like an incredibly elegant solution to long range telemetry.
