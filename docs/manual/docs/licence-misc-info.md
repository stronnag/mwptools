In addition to {{ mwp }}, the following {{ inav }} mission planners (and GCS in some cases) exist, in various states of usefulness, at least:

* [INAV Configurator (for inav 2.x)](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/tree/2.6.1), limited planning support
* [INAV Configurator (for inav 3.x and later)]( https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator), supports almost all current WP types. Development branch / [Preview builds](http://seyrsnys.myzen.co.uk/inav-configurator-next/) are also available; current and previews may be augmented with [impload](https://codeberg.org/stronnag/impload/) to upload missions to 2.x firmware.
* [Drone Helper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/drone-helper/9ncs8zwxn58x?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) (Windows 10), reportedly discontinued 2024-09.
* [Ezgui](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ezio.multiwii&hl=en_GB), [MissionPlanner for INAV](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eziosoft.ezgui.inav&hl=en) (Android) Unsupported, obsolete. May not work with either contemporary Android or INAV firmware.

* [Apmplanner2](https://ardupilot.org/planner2/) with [impload](https://codeberg.org/stronnag/impload/). Ardupilot planner, missions can be uploaded to INAV using [impload](https://codeberg.org/stronnag/impload/).
* [qgroundcontrol](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/) with [impload](https://codeberg.org/stronnag/impload/). Ardupilot planner, missions can be uploaded to INAV using [impload](https://codeberg.org/stronnag/impload/).

The following alternatives exist for **mwp's survey / area planner** :

* iforce2d's [online planner](http://www.iforce2d.net/surveyplanner)
* [qgroundcontrol](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/) with [impload](https://codeberg.org/stronnag/impload/). Generic surveys and corridor plans are supported. [Example images](https://codeberg.org/stronnag/impload/releases/tag/3.146.697).
