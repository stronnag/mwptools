### OSD information

When flying waypoints, if the mission is also loaded into {{ mwp }}, {{ mwp }} can display some limited OSD information.

![mwp-osd](images/mwp-osd.png){: width="75%" }

Various settings (colour, items displayed etc.) are defined by [settings](mwp-Configuration.md#dconf-gsettings).
