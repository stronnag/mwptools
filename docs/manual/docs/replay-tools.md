# Replay Tools

In order to replay log files, {{ mwp }} has a number of external dependencies, in particular the **flightlog2x** `fl2ltm` tool provided by the [bbl2kml](https://github.com/stronnag/bbl2kml) repository. As well as providing replay tools for {{ mwp }}, the  [bbl2kml](https://github.com/stronnag/bbl2kml) tools offer the facility to generate  attractive animated KML / KMZ files for visualisation in **google-earth**.

[bbl2kml](https://github.com/stronnag/bbl2kml) binary packages are provided for many popular platforms.

## Log replay

{{ mwp }} can replay a number of "flight log" formats. Other artefacts such as mission files / safehomes / (geozones) can be displayed while the replay is in progress.

### Location rebase

You may wish to obfuscate the location of log replay, particularly if you are publishing screen shots or vidoes. The `--rebase` option allows this. `--rebase` requires a latitude and longitude of the relocated position; the latitude and longitude may be separated by comma, semi-colon or space (the latter two quoted or shell escape) and may be decimal degrees or DD:MM:SS.ss format. The following would relocate a replay to Narita Airport in Japan (plausible denial, protect the innocent etc.):

    mwp --rebase 35.761000,140.378945 -b reloc-test.TXT -m reloc-test.mission
    mwp --rebase 35.761000\;140.378945 -b reloc-test.TXT -m reloc-test.mission
	mwp --rebase 35.761000\ 140.378945 -b reloc-test.TXT -m reloc-test.mission
	mwp --rebase "35:45:39.6N 140:22:44.2E" -b reloc-test.TXT -m reloc-test.mission

## Blackbox replay

In order to replay blackbox logs, you additionally need [inav blackbox tools](https://github.com/iNavFlight/blackbox-tools), specifically `blackbox_decode`). Binary packages are provided for many popular platforms. The minimum required version in 0.4.4, the latest release is recommended.

## OpenTX / EdgeTX logs (CRSF and Smartport)

OpenTX enables the storage of CRSF and Smartport telemetry logs on a transmitter's SD-Card. These logs contain telemetry information transmitted from the flight controller.

{{ mwp }} can replay these logs, in a similar manner to the replay of Blackbox or mwp logs, albeit with less detail and typically at lower data rates.

* Enable RX telemetry on the FC
* Enable telemetry logging on the TX
* Post flight, transfer the log from the LOGS directory of the SD card to your computer
* Replay the log using the Replay OTX Log (or Load OTX Log for a "fast-forward" rendering)
* Limited support is available of TX logs from Ardupilot.

No addition software requirements.

## BulletGCSS Logs

Requires that {{ mwp }} is built with [MQTT support](mqtt---bulletgcss-telemetry.md).

No addition software requirements.

## Ardupilot logs

Requires Ardupilot's [mavlogdump.py](https://github.com/ArduPilot/pymavlink).

## mwp JSON logs

No addition requirements.

## mwp "raw" logs

mwp "raw" logs are either recorded directly in mwp (`--raw-log`) for indirectly using the external [`mwp-serial-cap` tool](https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools/blob/master/cmd/mwp-serial-cap/README.md).  The logs generated by `mwp` and `mwp-serial-cap` contain meta-data describing the size and time of each item recorded; `mwp` can also play 3rd party logs that are 'plain' rw data (i.e. without any timing meta-data).

Recent versions of `mwp` contain a "Replay mwp RAW log" menu item that automates the manual process described below. This provides a dialogue to select the raw log file and an optional delay which is applied every 16 bytes read.

Otherwise it is necessary to build and install [`mwp-log-replay`](https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools/blob/master/src/samples/mwp-log-replay/README.md) and run it outside of mwp,

    # Start mwp as a UDP listener, port is arbitrary, here 40001 is chosen
    ## -a connect immediately without user intervention
    ## -d serial-device. No host part means it listens for remote connections
    ## listen on UDP port 40001

    mwp  -a -d udp://:40001

    # In another  terminal  (even other machine if you replace localhost with the machine running mwp)

    mwp-log-replay -d udp://localhost:40001 /path/to/my/logfile.raw

Raw logs containing MSP, LTM, MAVLink, CRSF and MPM Smartport and IBUS messages can be replayed.

## Pause / Resume

The playing state may be toggled with the **space** bar. If a [video is associated with the blackbox replay](mwp_video_player.md), then pausing the video will pause the blackbox replay and vice-versa.

## Display of RC Stick positions

Where such data is available (Blackbox, OTX/ETX logs), {{ mwp }} can display the position of the 'sticks'. This is displayed in the bottom right corner of the map.

* Initially, a "refresh" icon is shown
* Clicking this icon will show the sticks display
* A right mouse click on the sticks display reveals a "Hide" option. Clicking this reverts to the icon.
