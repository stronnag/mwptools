10. [Sensor status and flight timer](#sensors-and-flight-status-10)

In the sections that follow, there will be a brief summary of each part; more detail will then provided in subsequent sections.

## Menu Bar (1)

The following tables summarise the available menu options. Where usage is not obvious, operation will be described later on.

## Map and Mission Settings (2)

A number of different map products are available. {{ mwp }} offers the mapping library (`libshumate`) defaults, MapBox, Esri Clarity, Esri World Imagery. (deprecated Bing Map), and [user defined options](mwp-Configuration.md/#additional-map-sources-sourcesjson), for example [anonymous maps](Black-Ops.md).

These map products have different maximum zoom levels, (typically between 18-20), and in at least one case, are not globally consistent (Esi World Imagery has imagery tiles at zoom 19 in populated areas but returns a "no data" tile at zoom 19 in less populated areas). mwp cannot 'fix' this.

Note that Bing Maps is deprecated by Microsoft, and MapBox will only be offered if the user has supplied a MapBox API key. The Bing option will be removed some time after the service is ended (though cached data should still work).

The zoom level may be selected from the control here, or by zooming the map with the mouse wheel.

The user may add a "Gazetteer" layer (Places and Transportation) overlay to any other map product, by toggling the "Gazetteer" button:

![off](images/gazetteer-off.png)

![on](images/gazetteer-on.png)


The **+Add WPs** (Edit WPs)  button enables mission edit mode (click on the map to create a WP, drag to move, right mouse button for properties). Graphical WP editing may be augmented by the table orientated [mission table view](mission-editor.md), which allows additional control (altitude, speed, special functions, for example [fly-by-home](Fly-By-Home-waypoints-(inav-4-new-feature).md) waypoints).

The "Active Mission" drop down supports {{ inav }} 4.0+ [multi-mission](inav-4.0-multi-missions.md). There is also a **mission manager** item under the **Edit** menu.

## Communications and telemetry settings (3)

There is a (blue "!" in the example) 'navigation safe' status icon. If this icon is shown (i.e. navigation is _unsafe_, then clicking on the item will provide more information:

![navunsafe](images/nav-unsafe.png){: width="20%" }

The **Device** drop-down offers detected and pre-set (**Preferences**) devices for the FC / telemetry port. The device syntax is described the [Device and Protocol definition](mwp-multi-procotol.md) chapter.

The **Protocol Selection** drop-down (showing **Auto** in the reference image) allows the user to provide a hint as to communication protocols available on **Device**. These are further described in the [Device and Protocol definition](mwp-multi-procotol.md) article.

The **Connect / Disconnect** button connects / disconnects the displayed device.

## Side Bar Visibility (4)

Toggling this button will hide or show the side bar (6).

## Map Area (5)

The map area displays the currently selected map at the desired zoom level. The map may be managed using familiar controls (drag, scroll wheel etc).

## Side Bar elements (6)

The side bar displays a set if user defined UI elements ("dockets") that display flight / sensor information.

See [Side Bar Management](dock.md). In the **main window screen shot** (left to right, top to bottom) we have:

* Artificial horizon
* Vario Indicator
* RSSI / LQ Indocator
* Direction Status (Heading (Position Estimator/Compass v. GPS). Useful to diagnose mag EMF interference on multi-rotors).
* Flight View. General geo-spatial information.
* Battery status. Current usage is also shown when available.

## Location (7)

The location of the mouse pointer on the map. Position in the user's preferred format and ground elevation are shown.

## FC Information (8)

Displays the firmware, version and build with API information, profile and flight mode.

## Vehicle Visualisation (9)

* **Follow** : [user setting](mwp-Configuration.md#dconf-gsettings) `auto-follow`. whether the map always displays the aircraft icon and tracks (requires GPS).
* **In View / Centre On / Moviong Map** : Defined how to scroll the map to keep the aircraft in view.
    * **In View** : The map is only panned when the vehicle would otherwise be off-screen.
	* **Centre On**  : The vehicle is always centre of the screen and the map pans as required.
	* **Moving Map**  : The vehicle is always centre of the screen, vertically aligned, the map pans and rotates as required.

## Sensors and flight status (10)

* **Logger** : Generate mwp logs (JSON format).
* **Audio** : [user setting](mwp-Configuration.md#dconf-gsettings) `audio-on-arm`. Whether to "speak" status information.

The green / red bars show gyro / acc / baro / mag / gps / sonar sensor status. If a required sensor fails, a map annotation will be displayed, together with an audible alarm (image from legacy version).
