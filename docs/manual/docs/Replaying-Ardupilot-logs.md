# Ardupilot log replay

## Requirements

It is possible to replay Ardupilot logs in the same way as one can replay blackbox, OpenTX / EdgeTX and BulletGCCS logs. This also requires [flightlog2x tools](https://github.com/stronnag/bbl2kml) 1.0.24 or more recent.

* It is necessary to install an Ardupilot tool to decode the logs [mavlogdump.py](https://github.com/ArduPilot/pymavlink).

As the author does not have any (useful) AP logs, contributions are welcome.
