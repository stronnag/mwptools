# Support Policy

## How, where

* Github issues preferred
* RCG, inav discord and telegram
  * Most likely you will be requested to raise a Gihub issue for non-trivial cases.

## Supported OS

* Arch Linux
* Debian Stable and later (`testing`, `sid`)
* Ubuntu latest and latest LTS (prior release where latest is also LTS).
* Fedora latest
* FreeBSD latest `RELEASE`

## Supported infrastructure

* Native hardware (x64_x86, ia32, aarch64).
* Non-proprietary video driver.
* qemu/kvm virtualisated instances.
* Little endian (big endian never tested).

## Unsupported

* Anything else!

Problem reports on non-supported platforms are unlikely to be dismissed without _some_ consideration, however it's unlikely that too much time be expended on such environments unless the problem can also be demonstrated on a supported platform.
