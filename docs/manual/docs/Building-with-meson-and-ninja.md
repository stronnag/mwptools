# Build / install mwp (Generic)

## Overview

If you just want to install {{ mwp }} on a Debian /derivative,  x64_64, then you can install the reasonably recent binary `.deb` package from the [Release Area](https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools/releases).

For Arch Linux, you can install the AUR package `mwptools-git`. This tracks `master`.

Otherwise, if you're using a different (not Debian based) distribution, just curious about building mwptools, you want to explore other tools and scripts in the repository or you're using a different architecture (ia32, Arm7, aarch64, riscv64, ppc etc.), or you want the most recent code, then you can build from source. This is the recommended installation method.

The **mwptools** suite is built using the [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/SimpleStart.html) and [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) toolchain. For most users these will be automatically provided by a `build-essentials` type of package.

For Debian and derivatives there is a ["one stop" installation script](#easy-first-time-install-on-debian-and-derivatives), (based on Debian "Sid", ymmv), as well as a x86_64 "Release" `.deb` archive. For older Debian based OS, you may need slightly different or additional packages(`libxml2-dev/`, `libsdl2-dev` vice `libsdl2-compat-dev`).

For Fedora, the is a also a documented list of packages.

For Arch, the `PKGBLD` lists the required packages.

For MacOS, use Homebrew to install required packages, having evinced the names from one of the Linux guides.

For Windows (MSys2), see [Github discussion #182](https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools/discussions/182) for dependencies and workarounds).

For any other distribution / platform / OS, any of the above documents should give you an idea of the packages required, typically:

* Gtk4 (4.14)
* libsoup3 (3.2)
* libshumate (1.3)
* meson (1.40)
* blueprint-compiler (0.12.0)
* libvte4
* libadwaita-1 (1.5)
* libsecret-1
* librsvg
* sdl2
* gstreamer / gst-plugins-base-libs etc.
* readline

Numbers is parenthesis indicate a minimum version. Modern OS should be able to satisfy these requirements.

## Usage

### Normative guide

Note that the normative build reference is the `INSTALL` file in the source tree. This is most current documentation.

### First time

Set up the `meson` build system from the top level. Note that `_build` is a directory that is created by `meson setup`; you can use what ever name you wish, and can have multiple build directories for different options (e.g `_build` for local and `_sysbuild` for system wide installations.

    meson setup _build --buildtype=release --strip [--prefix $HOME/.local]

* For a user / non-system install, set `--prefix $HOME/.local`
    - This will install the binaries in `$HOME/.local/bin`, which should be added to `$PATH` as required.
* For a Linux system wide install, set `--prefix /usr`
* For FreeBSD (*BSD), for a system-wide install,  don't set `--prefix` as the default (`/usr/local`) is suitable

Unless you need a multi-user setup, a local install is preferable, as you don't need `sudo` to install, and you'll not risk messing up build permissions.

### "Easy" first-time install on Debian and derivatives

* Download the [first time build script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stronnag/mwptools/master/docs/deb-install.sh)
* Make it executable `chmod +x deb-install.sh`
* Run it `./deb-install.sh -y`
* Note that the script may ask for a password to install system packages
* The resulting executables are in `~/.local/bin`. Ensure this exists on `$PATH`; modern distros should do this for you.

### Build and update

	ninja -C _build
    # for a local install
    ninja -C _build install
    # for system install
    ninja -C _build
    sudo ninja -C _build install

### Accessing the serial port

The user needs to have read / write permissions on the serial port in order to communicate with a flight controller. This is done by adding the user to a group:

* Arch Linux: `sudo usermod -aG uucp $USER`
* Debian / Fedora (and derivatives): `sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER`
* All Linux with `systemd`: In you log in via `systemd`'s `loginctl`, then you can create a `udev` rule that does not rquire the user being a member of a particular group:

		#less /etc/udev/rules.d/45-stm32.rules
		SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5740", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1", ENV{ID_MM_CANDIDATE}="0"
		SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="df11", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"

* FreeBSD: `sudo pw group mod dialer -m $USER`

### Troubleshooting and Hints

#### Migrate from a system install to a user install

Either use separate build directories, or reconfigure.

    cd _build
    sudo ninja uninstall
    meson --reconfigure --prefix=$HOME/.local
    ninja install

#### Fixing build permissions

If you install to system locations, it is possible that `sudo ninja install` will write as `root` to some of the install files, and they become non-writable to the normal user.

* In the `build` directory, run `sudo chown -R $USER .`
* Consider migrating to a local install.

### Help!!!!

#### You've installed a new version but you still get the old one!

If you used the `deb-install.sh` script, then it installed everything into `$HOME/.local/bin` (and other folders under `~/.local`). This is  nice because:

* mwp does not pollute the system directories;
* you don't need `sudo` to install it.

Linux (like most other OS) has the concept of a `PATH`, a list of places where it looks for executable files). You can see this from a terminal:

    ## a colon separated list
    echo $PATH

So check that `$HOME/.local/bin` is on `$PATH`; preferably near the front.

If it is, then the problem may be  that the older mwp also exists elsewhere on the PATH, and the system will not re-evaluate the possible chain of locations if it previously found the file it wants.

So, maybe you have an old install. You didn't remove it (alas); so the system thinks that mwp is `/usr/bin/mwp`; in fact it's now `$HOME/.local/bin/mwp`

If `$HOME/.local/bin` is on the PATH before `/usr/bin`, the you have two choices:

    # reset the path search
    hash -r
    # mwp, where art thou? Hopefully now is ~/.local/bin
    which mwp
    # From **this terminal** executing mwp will run the location reported by `which mwp`

or

Log out, log in. The PATH will be re-evaluated.

If `$HOME/.local/bin` is not on PATH. then it needs to be added to a login file (`.profile`, `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile` etc.). Modern distros do this for you, however if you've updated an older install you may have to add it yourself.

    # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
    if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
        PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
    fi

    # set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
    if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
        PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
    fi

If an older (perhaps Makefile generated) mwp exists; then you should remove all evidence of an earlier system install.

    find /usr -iname \*mwp\*

review the list and as root, delete the old files. Do similar for blackbox-decode.

If you're content with the list, then (*caveat emptor*):

    sudo find /usr -iname \*mwp\* -delete

You'll still have to remove non-empty directories manually.

#### "ninja: error: loading 'build.ninja': No such file or directory

Something, or persons unknown has removed this file.

    cd mwptools
    meson setup --reconfigure _build --prefix ~/.local
    cd _build
    ninja install

#### ERROR: Dependency "?????" not found, tried pkgconfig

{{ mwp }} requires a new dependency. This ~~will~~ should be documented in the wiki [Recent Changes](https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools/wiki/Recent-Changes) document.

* Install the newly required dependencies
* Rerun your build
