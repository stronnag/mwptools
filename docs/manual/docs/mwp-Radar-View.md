# Radar View

{{ mwp }} supports the display of "radar" contacts. This provides a view of adjacent aircraft obtained from a number of sources:

* [Tracked Telemetry](mwp-telemetry-tracker.md). Secondary models tracked by telemetry (CRSF, LTM, MAVLink, Smartport, MPM(Flysky, Smaprtport)). Provided by RX Telemetry Mirroring or dedicated telemetry radios.
* [INAV-radar](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?3304673-iNav-Radar-ESP32-LoRa-modems). INAV radar works in conjunction with [INAV](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav) flight controllers to broadcast the location of UAS fitted with an ESP32 LoRa module. {{ mwp }} can listen to one of these modems in ground station mode to display the positions of the rest of the 'swarm' (up to 4 UAS); [technical / MSP details](#inav-radar).

* **General Aviation** from internet provider using a REST service delivering the dump1090/readsb  JSON [schema](https://github.com/wiedehopf/readsb/blob/dev/README-json.md). This schema is used by a number of both free and subscription web services.
* **General Aviation** typically reported using SDR (Software Defined Radios) using [SBS streaming TCP protocol](http://woodair.net/sbs/article/barebones42_socket_data.htm). This is generated by the open source [dump1090](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090) and [readsb](https://github.com/Mictronics/readsb-protobuf) open source applications with a SDR receiver, as well as commercial products.
* **General Aviation** typically reported using SDR (Software Defined Radios) using the [dump1090-fa](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090) JSON format.
* **General Aviation** typically reported using SDR (Software Defined Radios) using the [readsb](https://github.com/Mictronics/readsb-protobuf) "protobuf" format. This is the preferred way to access SDR ADSB / Mode-S data.
* **General Aviation** reported by the MAVLink 'Traffic Report' / 'ADSB Vehicle' message. Examples of available hardware include:
    * [uAvionix PingRX](https://uavionix.com/products/pingrx/), a compact device that receives ADS-B location data from full sized aircraft and publishes the locations as MAVLink. For a ground based installation, this device has around a 40Km detection radius. [MAVLink ICD](https://uavionix.com/downloads/integration/uAvionix%20Ping%20Integration%20Guide.pdf).
	* [Aerobits TT-SC1](https://www.aerobits.pl/product/aero/). Untested, but supports the same MAVLink API as the PingRX. [Product documentation](https://www.aerobits.pl/wp-content/uploads/ci_uploads_software/tt_sc1/technical_documentation_sc/OEM_SC_Datasheet_07o-v1.1.8.pdf).
* **General Aviation** reported using the `MSP2_ADSB_VEHICLE_LIST` message. This is generated by [INAV](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav) later than 7.1.0 when a PingRX or TT-SC1 device is attached to the flight controller. This is received by the main {{ mwp }} MSP port without user configuration (no need to set up a `radar-device`). Due to the size of  `MSP2_ADSB_VEHICLE_LIST` message, {{ mwp }} does not poll for `MSP2_ADSB_VEHICLE_LIST` by default, see the [setting](#settings) key `msp2-adsb`, below.

* Proximity alerts (visual and audible) for General Aviation (ADS-B / sbs-1 / dump1090 / readsb / Internet REST) aircraft, based on planned or actual home location or vehicle location.

For SDR (Software Defined Radios) using the [readsb](https://github.com/Mictronics/readsb-protobuf) or [dump1090](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090) where the SDR host has a web server configured to supply the generated "protobuf" or JSON output, then {{ mwp }} can obtain the data from the web server. Otherwise, it will be necessary to set up a small daemon on SDR host, see the `src/samples/adsb-extra` directory for further details.

Note that the SDR protocols may also be used with network services that provide ADS-B reports (usually for a fee or for provided local data).

## mwp Configuration

{{ mwp }} can receive the 'radar' data over one or more connections, anyof which may be active, and {{ mwp }} can receive and display 'own vehicle' telemetry (MSP, LTM, CRSF, Smartpost), [Tracked Telemetry](mwp-telemetry-tracker.md), 'INAV-radar', 'MAVlink Traffic' and General Aviation data simultaneously. Radar data may be received over:

* The main serial port device (see [caveat](#using-the-main-serial-port) for INAV-radar) and `MSP2_ADSB_VEHICLE_LIST`.
* device(s) defined by the `radar-device` CLI or configuration parameter (MAVLink Traffic, INAV-radar, SDR protocols)

The `radar-device` option is defined by the standard {{ mwp }} naming scheme:

* A serial device node, with optional baud rate, e.g.:
    * `/dev/ttyACM0`, `/dev/ttyUSB4@567600`, `/dev/rfcomm3`
    * Serial defaults to 115200 baud, but may be set in the device name (@baudrate)
* A Bluetooth address (for BT bridges)
    * `00:0B:0D:87:13:A2`
* A UDP address, e.g. for simulation, recording replays or serial multiplexer (INAV, mavlink).
    * `udp://:30001` local UDP listener.
* An online REST service providing the `readsb` JSON format. For now, mwp supports services that offer and end point of the form `https://host/v2/point/lat/lon/`. These are defined using the `adsbx://` pseudo URI, and require the host, range in nautical miles (NM) and the refresh interval (milliseconds). Some suppliers limit the maximum range to 250NM and minimum update rate of 1 second.
    * `adsbx://api.adsb.one?range=40&interval=1000`
  Please see [below](#adsbx-rest-providers) for the mwp implementation details.
* A `readsb` protobuf source or `dump1090` JSON source over `http`/`https`, for example, using hosts `woozle` (protobuf) and `jagular` (JSON):
    * `http://woozle/readsb/data/aircraft.pb`
	* `http://jagular/dump1090/data/aircraft.json`
* A `readsb` protobuf source, defined by a special URI:
    * `pba://[[host][:port]]` (requires `adsbpbsrv` on the SDR host).
  Host and port are optional, defaulting to `localhost` and `38008`. So the minimal "URI" is `pba://`.
* A `dump1090` JSON source, defined by a special URI:
    * `jsa://[[host][:port]]` (requires `jsacsrv` on the SDR host).
  Host and port are optional, defaulting to `localhost` and `37007`. So the minimal "URI" is `jsa://`.
* A SBS protocol source, defined by a special URI:
    * `sbs://[[host][:port]]`
  Host and port are optional, defaulting to `localhost` and `30003`. So the minimal "URI" is `sbs://`.

For "Telemetry Tracking", please see its [separate article](mwp-telemetry-tracker.md).

The specific (not shared with the main serial port) radar device(s) may be defined on the command line, or in the static command options file (`~/.config/mwp/cmdopts`):

 * `mwp --radar-device udp://:30001`
 * `$ cat ~/.config/mwp/cmdopts`

    	# Default options for mwp
    	# using udev rule to associate a specifc USB-TTL adaptor to a name
		--radar-device=/dev/pingRX@57600

Multiple devices may be defined, e.g.

* As separate options, `--radar-device=/dev/pingRX@57600 --radar-device /dev/inavradar@115200`
* As a comma separated list: `--radar-device=/dev/pingRX@57600,/dev/inavradar@115200`

Any bespoke `radar-device` is started automatically on startup (or when it shows up). It is not managed via the serial `Connect` button.

## ADSBX REST Providers

For many users using a (free) online REST service will be a simple option compared to using their own hardware devices.

### Supported providers

The intention is to support any provider that offers the `readsb` JSON response (sometimes called the ADSBExchange V2 API response). The query to get such a response may differ between providers, so for now the following providers are supported:

* adsb.lol
* adsb.one

These sources have the benefits of:

* Using the same REST API endpoint (`https://host/v2/point/lat/lon/range`)
* Are free to use
* Do not require registration
* Have few usage limits

### Configuration

Using (one of) the above providers requires that the user defines a `--radar-device` option using the `adsbx://` URI schema. It is necessary to supply the host name, the range (in nautical miles) and a refresh interval in milliseconds, in the format:
```
adsbx://host?range=R&interval=T
```
where

* `host` is the provider host (assumed available via https)
* `range` defines the range (R)  in nautical miles
* `interval` defines the refresh interval (T) in milliseconds

`--radar-device` may be given on the command line, or more conveniently in `~/.config/mwp/cmdopts`, for example:

```
--radar-device adsbx://api.adsb.lol?range=40&interval=1000
## or
--radar-device adsbx://api.adsb.one?range=40&interval=1000
```

### Adsbx Notes

* It is pointless to define both providers as they have much the same data
* The providers permit a maximum range of 250NM
* The providers have a minimum query interval of 1s (1000ms)
* As the APIs return the data as JSON, the results are verbose. Requesting a range of 250NM may seem like a good idea; however it is not useful for our purposes and will return a large volume of data, which may be sub-optimal using mobile internet in the field.
* `mwp` will use select a centre location based on [user choice and vehicle state](#location-and-alerts).

Where the data is provided by 3rd party volunteers, there may be limited coverage in remote areas (or areas with little air traffic).


## Using the main serial port

The main {{ mwp }} serial port may be used for MavLink Traffic and `MSP2_ADSB_VEHICLE_LIST` messages without any further configuration. For INAV-radar, to use the main MSP port for INAV-radar (vice using `--radar-device`), it is still necessary to add a command option to {{ mwp }}; it needs to told to relax the default inbound MSP direction check.

This is enabled as

    mwp --relaxed-msp

which should be 'mainly harmless' for normal operations. It's entirely acceptable to put this in `~/config/mwp/cmdopts` to make it the default, as the protocol check dilution is slight.

## Settings

The following `dconf` setting affect the radar function:

| Setting | Usage |
| ------- | ----- |
| `radar-list-max-altitude` | Maximum altitude (metres) to show targets in the radar list view; targets higher than this value will show only in the map view. Setting to 0 disables. Note that ADS-B altitudes are AMSL (or geoid) and SDR altitudes are "Flight Level" (standard atmosphere). |
| `radar-alert-altitude` | Target altitude (metres) below which ADS-B / SDR proximity alerts may be generated. Requires that 'radar-alert-range' is also set (none zero). Setting to 0 disables. Note that the above altitude datum. |
| `radar-alert-range` | Target range (metres) below which ADS-B / SDR proximity alerts may be generated. Requires that 'radar-alert-altitude' is also set (none zero). Setting to 0 disables. |
| `ga-alt` | Units for GA Altiude, enumerated as 0=m, 1=ft, 2=FL |
| `ga-range` | Units for GA Range, enumerated as 0=m, 1=km, 2=miles, 3=nautical miles |
| `ga-speed` | Units for GA Speed, enumerated as  0=m/s, 1=kph, 2=mph, 3=knots |
| `msp2-adsb` | Options for requesting MSP2_ADSB_VEHICLE_LIST. "off": never request, "on:" always request, "auto:" heuristic based on serial settings / bandwidth |

Note that proximity alerts require that both the `radar-alert-altitude` and `radar-alert-range` values are set.

## Location and Alerts

mwp selects a location for alerts based on the user choice and vehicle state. The same location will also be used for `adsbx://` (internet REST) services.

The following table defines how the location is selected, and the range check alert visualisation for that state.

|      | No location | GCS  | Home | Connection/GPS |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Sound | x | Y| x | Y |
| Toast | x | Y | x  | Y |
| Item Colour | x | Y | Y | Y |
| Base Position | View centre / SDR location | GCS | Home | Vehicle |


### Location Types

* **No location**: There is no home or vehicle location known.
* **GCS**: The user has enabled the GCS location icon, either from the View -> GCS Location menu item or a local GPS (via `gpsd`).
* **Home**: A home position is available, either from the vehicle GPS or a "fake" / "planned" home via Ctrl-Shift-H / creating a mission / loading a mission with stored home position.
* **Connection**: The vehicle is connected to mwp and is supplying a valid GPS location.

### Visualisation

* **Sound**: A beep is emitted every two seconds
* **Toast**: A transient, non-blocking notification at the base of the screem
* **Item Colour**: The aircraft icon will show in red, and the aircraft detail will be shown in the Gtk4 "error" style in the radar list.

## Usage

!!! note "Legacy Images"
    The images this section are from legacy mwp, however the capability is the same.

Once the radar interface is open, radar tracks are displayed on the map and in a list available from the "View -> Radar View' menu option.

* The list view is sort-able on the `Id`, `Status`, `Last` (time) and `Range` columns.
* The map visualisation may be toggled by the `Hide Tracks` (`Show Tracks`) button. This will also supress alerts.
* List and map views are updated in (near) real time.
* Settings for display units are used for positions, altitude and speed.

### Name

| Type | Usage |
| ---- | ----- |
| INAV-radar | Node Id (typically 'A' - 'D') |
| Traffic Report | Callsign if reported, otherwise [ICAO number] |
| SDR | Callsign if reported, otherwise [Mode S hexadecimal code] |
| Telemetry | User defined for automatically allocated, prefixed by `TTRK-` |
| General Aviation | Callsign if reported, otherwise [ICAO number] |

### Status

Radar contacts have one of the following status values:

| Status | Explanation |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Undefined | ADS-B: Not shown in list or on the map, INAV-Radar not armed / updated |
| Stale | The last contact was more that 120s previous. Displayed in the list and shown on the map with reduced intensity or an INAV-radar node has 'lost' status |
| Armed | An active INAV-radar contact |
| Hidden | A MAVLink Traffic /SDR contact is between 5 and 10 minutes old. It remains in the list but is not displayed in the map. MAVLink Traffic Report / SDR tracks are removed from the list (and internal storage) after 10 minutes inactivity. INAV-radar ground station. Stale / 'Lost' INAV-radar contacts do not expire, as they may relate to a lost model. |
| ADS-B | A live MAVLink Traffic report |
| SDR | SDR radio report (sbs, json, protobuf) |
| ADSBX | General Aviation internet REST service |

The number displayed after the status text is:

| Type | Usage |
| ---- | ----- |
| INAV-radar | The link quality |
| Traffic Report | Time since last communication in seconds |
| SDR reports | Time since last communication in seconds |
| General Aviation | Time since last communication in seconds |

### Columns

The columns are sortable. Note that since the introduction of [Telemetry Tracking](mwp-telemetry-tracker.md), a new column "*" has been added, this contains a single character indicating the source:

| Indicator | Source |
| --------- | ------ |
| A         | ADS-B via MAVLink or MSP |
| I         | INAV Radar |
| S         | ADS-B via SDR protocol |
| T         | Telemetry Tracker |
| X         | General Aviation internet REST service |

## Simulators

There are simulators for both INAV-radar and MAVLink 'Traffic Report' (e.g. uAvionix PingRX) in the `mwptools/src/samples/radar` directory.

There is a replay tool for SBS CSV logs `mwptools/src/samples/sbs-test/sbs-player.rb`.

## Changing the Radar Symbols

Many map symbols used by {{ mwp }} can be changed by the user; in the image above, the INAV radar node symbol has been changed from the default stylised INAV multirotor to a smaller version of the mission replay "paper plane" symbol as described in [creating your own icon](mwp-Configuration.md#settings-precedence-and-user-updates).

## Protocol documentation

###  MAVLink 'Traffic Report' (e.g. uAvionix PingRX)

The MAVLink implementation is [comprehensively documented](https://uavionix.com/downloads/integration/uAvionix%20Ping%20Integration%20Guide.pdf) by the vendor.

### INAV radar

The following is required by a device wishing to act as a ground node (it either masquerades as an INAV FC, or declares itself a GCS)

* Receive and respond to the following MSP data requests:
    * MSP_FC_VARIANT (responding as `INAV` or (from 2021/05/06) `GCS` for generic ground control stations).
    * MSP_FC_VERSION (in `INAV` and `GCS` modes)
    * MSP_NAME (in `INAV` and `GCS` modes)
    * MSP_STATUS (in `INAV` mode)
    * MSP_ANALOG (in `INAV` mode)
    * MSP_BOXIDS (in `INAV` mode)
    * MSP_RAW_GPS (in `INAV` mode)
* Receive unsolicited
    * MSP2_COMMON_SET_RADAR_POS

Note that the device firmware assumes that MSP buffer sizes are "as specification"; exceeding the expected message buffer size may crash the device (mea culpa).

In `GCS` mode, the node is passive; it does not use a LoRa slot and does not attempt to broadcast a location. In `INAV` mode, the node takes up a LoRa slot and is expected to reply to the additional MSP queries.

{{ mwp }}'s behaviour is defined by the [GCS Location](gcs-features.md#gcs-location-icon)

* If the [GCS Location](gcs-features.md#gcs-location-icon) is defined (when the radar device is initialised, then {{ mwp }} will respond as `INAV` and return the [GCS Location](gcs-features.md#gcs-location-icon), which may be driven by gpsd if required.
* Otherwise, mwp will respond as a passive `GCS`.

### SBS CSV protocol

[Protocol description](http://woodair.net/sbs/article/barebones42_socket_data.htm).
