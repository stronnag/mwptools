mwptools installation instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have to build from source (this is a feature). In order to do this
you will need to satisfy some external dependencies. Dependencies
(packages) are listed in the docs/ directory for Fedora, FreeBSD and
Ubuntu (and thus Debian and derivatives).

You should use your OS package manager (dnf, pkg, apt-get) as root (or
via sudo) to install OS packages.

For other operating systems it will be necessary to work out what is
required from one of these lists. There is also some information on
installing on Cygwin in docs/, mainly for the clinically certifiable.

Optional Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to replay blackbox logs in mwp, it is necessary to install
a Ruby language interpreter and the open source blackbox_tools
package. Instructions on doing this may be found on the bblox_replay
directory (e.g. bbox-replay/replay_bbox_ltm.pdf). For most Linux
distributions and FreeBSD, you should install Ruby using your OS
package manager.

Note that the mwptools installer will now install replay_bbox_ltm.rb
for you.

Installation Location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have the choice of installing:

* "System Install" : in system directories (/usr/bin et al); or
* "Local Install" " in the user's home directory (~/bin et al).

There are advantages and disadvantages to both:

System Install : You have to install as root and you write to system
       	       	 locations

Local Install :  You don't have to be root to install, but you do have
      	      	 to add some environment configuration items.

******** For most users, a system install is the best choice. ********

Common Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the mwptools source directory:

$ make

Then for System Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 $ sudo make install

or for Local Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 $ make local

 For the Local Install only, add to ~/.profile (or another file
sourced at login), the following lines:

 export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
 export XDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/share:$HOME/.local/share
 (or for FreeBSD)
 export XDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/local/share:$HOME/.local/share:

 In order for the changes to .profile to have effect, it is easiest to
 log and log in again.


Did I mention that the system install is recommended?

Short Cuts
~~~~~~~~~~

Build and installation can be simplified as:

$ make && sudo make install ## System wide
or
$ make local                ## Local

Caveat
~~~~~~

Don't run the build (make) phase as root (sudo).

Switching from a local install to a system install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the default has been a local install, users with an installation
prior to 2016-03-03 may wish to change to a system install. In order
to do this, it is necessary to purge local files as follows:

$ rm -f ~/bin/{cf-cli,cf-cli-ui,mspsim,mwp,mwp_ath}
$ rm -f ~/bin/{qproxy,switchedit,ublox-cli,ublox-geo}
$ rm -rf ~/.local/share/{cf-cli,cf-cli-ui,mspsim,mwp,mwp_ath}
$ rm -rf ~/.local/share/{qproxy,switchedit,ublox-cli,ublox-geo}
$ rm -f~/.local/share/glib-2.0/schemas/org.mwptools.planner.gschema.xml
$ rm -f ~/.local/share/glib-2.0/schemas/gschemas.compiled
$ glib-compile-schemas ~/.local/share/glib-2.0/schemas
# ignore any "No schema files found: doing nothing." output

The above commands are in samples/clean-local.sh. In the event that
wished to remove a system install, see samples/clean-system.sh.

You should also remove any definition of XDG_DATA_DIRS added to
.profile **for mwp**
